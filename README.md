# Random-face-generator
This Java application generates random faces with customizable shapes and colors using JavaFX. It allows users to select different shapes for the face, eyes, and mouth, as well as choose colors for each feature. Upon clicking the "Draw Face" button, the application draws the random face based on the selected options. If the colors of facial features are the same as the face's color, the application throws a custom exception and resets the colors to default values.

## How to use:

1)Clone or download the project files from my repository to your local machine.

2)Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

3)Locate the RandomFaceGenerator.java file within the project. Compile and run the RandomFaceGenerator.java file, which contains the main method. 

This will initiate the application.
