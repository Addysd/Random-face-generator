# Random-face-generator
This Java application generates random faces with customizable shapes and colors using JavaFX. It allows users to select different shapes for the face, eyes, and mouth, as well as choose colors for each feature. Upon clicking the "Draw Face" button, the application draws the random face based on the selected options. If the colors of facial features are the same as the face's color, the application throws a custom exception and resets the colors to default values.
